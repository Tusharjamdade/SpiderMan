                Peter Parker is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
                media franchise–based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—also known by his alias,
                Spider-Man. Parker is initially depicted as a student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology
                who received spider-like and superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Parker
                initially uses his powers to fight crime as a vigilante in Queens.

                Parker is approached by Tony Stark, who mentors him and eventually recruits him into the Avengers during
                the conflict against Thanos. Following the Blip and Stark's death, Parker encounters Quentin Beck while
                on a school trip; Beck frames Parker for his murder and reveals his identity to the world, prompting
                Parker to seek Stephen Strange's help to reverse this. Strange's spell causes the multiverse to
                fracture, bringing in alternate versions of Spider-Man and their enemies. In order to repair the damage,
                Strange casts a spell that permanently erases the world's shared knowledge of Parker's civilian persona,
                including his relationships with his loved ones, friends, and other superhero allies.
